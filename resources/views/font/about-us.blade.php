                            <p class="section-desc text-grey">
                                Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited Singapore in 2006, wearing a strapless gown
                                and a diamond crown on her head. Her face is flawless and charming. Elizabeth came to
                                Queenstown to communicate with the local people face to face. Many local women faced the
                                Queenâ€™s demeanor and believed that Queen Elizabeth was the most beautiful woman in the
                                world. She was 80 years old and her skin was still smooth, supple, healthy and delicate.
                                Kelly You, the founder of the Xizhiyan brand, made up his mind at that time, hoping to one
                                day create a facial skin care product for women all over the world, so that women can have
                                healthy skin. This has planted a seed that needs to be germinated for the founding of
                                MYQUEEN.


                                With her dedication to "having healthy skin" and her travels overseas, and even visited the
                                UK many times, Kelly You has been looking for answers to how to have healthy skin. As a
                                result, any skin care products are not the source of healthy skin. According to well-known
                                dermatology According to the doctor, one of the things to get healthy skin is persistence
                                day after day. Even for the Queen of England, the essence of skin care is sunscreen,
                                cleansing and bedtime care.

                                Second is sun protection. Sun protection is indispensable in skin care procedures in any
                                country. In the documentary produced by the British BBC, the truth is revealed. The biggest
                                cause of wrinkles on the skin is sun exposure, which is the cause of all wrinkles. Among
                                them, sun exposure accounts for 75%, and all effective anti-aging stunts are sun protection.
                                Even in Britain, which is rainy all year round, the Queen of England also pays great
                                attention to sun protection, often wearing hats and sunglasses outdoors.

                                Furthermore, skin conditioning needs to be solved from the root cause. No organism can do
                                without water. Water is the most important element of life metabolism. Water can come from
                                daily skin care and food. Moisturizing and post-sun repair are the "source of conditioning".

                                As time passed, the time came to April 2019. In an occasional social interaction, Kelly You
                                met Dr. Eric Lim, an expert in skin care formulations, and learned that he is a well-known
                                person in the skin care industry with an independent skin laboratory and numerous skins
                                behind him. With the support of academic experts, Kelly You believes that the time has come
                                to create a healthy skin brand, and immediately the MYQUEEN brand and Xizhiyan Lab were
                                officially registered in Singapore in May 2019.
                                Determined to make the myth of agelessness of Queen Elizabeth of England happen to women all
                                over the world, this is the common vision of Kelly You and MYQUEEN brand.

                                Adhering to the concept of skin care based on the study of plant extracts, it is committed
                                to the research of biological cell gene expression and skin physiological metabolism, as
                                well as the application and development of biological skin care products. Relying on the
                                cutting-edge technology of cell biology, dermatology, cosmetic science and other
                                disciplines, through a variety of advanced biotechnology to obtain biologically active
                                ingredients homologous to the human body, using biological gene expression and advanced
                                cosmetic science and technology to improve through regulation at the molecular level The
                                internal environment of skin growth promotes the growth of healthy cells, and eventually
                                replaces the problematic cells of aging, so that the skin presents a healthy state after
                                treatment.

                            <p>The original intention of establishing the laboratory was to conduct research and development
                                and production of related skin care products based on the research results on the basis of
                                in-depth research on the characteristics of female skin. Find the psychological needs of
                                consumers and provide scientific and effective products. XZY skin care laboratory has
                                gathered a large number of skin care industry veterans, medical experts, professors,
                                research and development consultants and other professionals, who have accumulated and tried
                                in women's skin care and beauty for many years. Accumulated a wealth of industry experience
                                in the production process of beauty and skin care products, and conducted in-depth
                                scientific research on the characteristics of female skin
